# DirectCapture

C# library aimed at capturing `AVI` files playable in [DirectShow](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/win32/directshow/directshow) as Bitmap.  
Includes a few simple utility classes.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to perform frame capture against modern, general-purpose video codecs, do not hesitate to consider OpenCV or ffmpeg.  
> This is for niche purposes and experimental. I would do so if I could.
