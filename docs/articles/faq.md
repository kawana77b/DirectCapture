# FAQ

## Why did you create this?

`DirectShow` is a very legacy API, but it may be necessary for organizations that deal with some specialized video codecs.
This library helps to analyze frames by capturing images from video of such codecs and allowing them to be handled as `Bitmap`.

Also, information about this legacy API is becoming less and less available every day. While there are many examples of libraries related to camera devices, there seem to be few examples that handle `AVI` files. This is intended to be one of the use cases and that many people can use as a code reference.
